# Thanks-giving-Dinner
Analyzing data on Thanksgiving dinner in the U.S.
I am analyzing this dataset to discover regional and income-based patterns in what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner.
There are 1058 rows and 65 columns.
The file has responses to an online survey about what Amercians eat for Thanksgiving dinner.
Each survey respondent was asked questions about what they typically eat for Thanksgiving, along with some demographic questions, like their gender, income, and location.
I will explore the data and try to find interesting patterns.
